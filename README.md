# Bloomberg-P-L-Analysis-and-Visualization

# Case Description
Bloomberg terminals are a powerful tool in the hands of financial professionals. But the data downloaded from there requires significant polishing and formatting before it can be presented to decision-makers.

In this Analysis and Visualization of P&L Data in Excel project, we’re going to look at Bloomberg data and prepare a concise report and visualizations.

To perform this task well, we must use advanced Excel lookup functions, apply professional formatting, and create appealing charts to help management understand financial performance at first glance, which is challenging to do with this data. But these are the type of tasks a well-prepared analyst needs to be able to perform on the job.

Finally, we interpreted the firm’s financials using trend and profitability margin analysis. We synthesize complex financial P&L data into easy-to-understand insights that can be presented to a professional audience.
